Notes about setting up MQTT

* Disable or open Ubuntu firewall on pc.
    sudo ufw disable

* Shutdown mosquitto daemon so we can run in forground.
    sudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto shutdown


in a terminal, launch mosquitto mqtt broker:
    mosquitto

in another terminal, launch a subscriber to listen to events on our topic:
    mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.10.200 -t trapStatus

in another terminal, publisher a message on our topic:
    mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.10.200 -t trapStatus -m 'hello'

the message should appear in the subscriber terminal.


ESP8266

Be sure to short across REST and GPIO16 on the ESP-12E
this will allow the wake-up to trigger the reset.
Otherwise, the ESP will shutdown and not wake its self up.

Use a capacitor (22uf or more?) on the power to handle surges when sending WiFi.

Currently using a surplus SO323(?) SMD LDO regulator 3V3.  Seems to work fine.
